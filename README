Gtk# is a .NET language binding for the GTK+ toolkit and assorted GNOME
libraries. Gtk# is free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL.

Building & Installing Gtk#:
---------------------------

    Install the gtk-3 development headers first. On Debian, this can be done using:
    apt-get install libgtk-3-dev

    The build is the traditional:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    You may want to consider using configure's prefix option to install
    Gtk# using the same prefix as Mono.  That way all of your .NET assemblies
    get placed in the same place, and you don't need to do any extra "configuring"
    to make it so mono (and mint) can find your assemblies.  In other words,
    doing something like:

        ./configure --prefix=`pkg-config --variable=prefix mono`
        make
        make install

    If you are compiling from GIT, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
    and will need to replace the configure above with autogen.sh.


The gui-thread-check profiler module.
-------------------------------------

    Since version 3 of gtk# a profiler called "gui-thread-check" is included as
    part of the install for debugging purposes. (It's located in the subfolder
    gtk/gui-thread-check .)

    This profiler module can be used to check if a GTK# application is trying to
    invoke gtk or gdk methods from a thread which is not the main GUI thread.

    To use it, run your application with the command:

        mono --profile=gui-thread-check yourapp.exe

    If the profiler is properly installed, you'll see an output like this:

        *** Running with gui-thread-check ***
        *** GUI THREAD INITIALIZED: 2861676352

    While the application is running, if the profiler detects a non-gui thread
    invoking gtk methods, it will print a warning message together with a
    stack trace. For example:

        *** GTK CALL NOT IN GUI THREAD: Widget.gtk_widget_get_parent
           Widget.get_Parent
           SourceEditorWidget.SetLastActiveEditor
           SourceEditorWidget.get_TextEditor
           SourceEditorWidget.get_Document
           SourceEditorWidget.HandleParseInformationUpdaterWorkerThreadDoWork
           BackgroundWorker.OnDoWork
           BackgroundWorker.ProcessWorker

    Also, people can get help with and discuss Gtk# on IRC via the
    #gtk# or #mono channels on the irc.gnome.org IRC server.

    People looking for general help with C# should visit the
    #c# channel on irc.freenode.net IRC server.


Developers:
-----------

    For developers wishing to "get started" with Gtk#, they are encouraged
    to read the Mono Hand Book:

        http://www.mono-project.com/Monkeyguide


Hackers:
--------

    For those who wish to help with the development of Gtk#, they should
    read the file named: HACKING.

    Also, anyone wishing to hack Gtk# is encouraged to join the Gtk#
    mailing list. And to visit the #gtk# IRC channel (on irc.gnome.org).
